The !*!% glows white on the $^~?@$?# tonight
Not a #!&*$**?* to be seen
A kingdom of #^&*#|?!~
And it looks like I'm the ###$!

The ?^#| is howling like this swirling &*|#& inside
Couldn't @|@| it in, heaven $?!~s I tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good @?#? you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them *?~&
Well, now they #%#$

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it *~*@ anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and *$&? the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the *#|@$ rage on
The |#@^ never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some ~~&?$|&^ makes everything seem small
And the |!?|^ that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and |#&~~ through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the #%|? and #~!
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me *&#
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the ??^?% rage on

My ^@?~* flurries through the air into the ground
My ^*$& is spiraling in ^?&~$^ fractals all around
And one thought ~|$stallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going @%#&, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
And I'll |^## like the $?@%| of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect &$^? is gone
Here I stand in the #&|^@ of day
Let the %^*^^ rage on
The ~&@~ never bothered me anyway
